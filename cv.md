I'm a ui/ux designer with experience in graphic design. I've chosen this area because analytics and creative activities are close to me.
I'm here because I want to delve even deeper into the IT field. I want to understand not only the design process, but all process of product development. I think this course be difficult for me, but I will try to study hard and take the most out of this course!
